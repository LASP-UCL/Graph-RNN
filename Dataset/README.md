# Dataset Creation

To create the Sythenthic Bodies Dataset we followed the work form Irene et al from "Temporal Interpolation of Dynamic Point Clouds using Convolutional Neural Networks" (https://github.com/jelmr/pc_temporal_interpolation).

In case of any doubt you will find a diferent code to achive the same data creation at https://github.com/jelmr/pc_temporal_interpolation
